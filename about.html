          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I’m a recent UCLA English graduate and I’ve been practicing journalism for more than three years at several publications, including my university’s student newspaper the Daily Bruin. I wore a lot of hats at the Bruin, as a columnist, an assistant Opinion editor, an enterprise writer and Campus News editor.</p>

          <p>For the next 10 weeks, I'll be interning at the LA Times as a news reporter.</p>

          <p>Last summer, I spent 10 weeks reporting for the Free Lance-Star — a local paper in the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area dedicated to community journalism. I wrapped up the internship with 16 A-1 stories and more than 40 clips.</p>

          <p>As a 2014 Bridget O’Brien Scholarship recipient, I traveled to the Philippines to work on a 20-day reporting project examining the impact of $12,000 UCLA students donated to Typhoon Yolanda relief efforts. The project won first place for Best News Series in the California College Media Association Awards.</p>

          <p>I will join Columbia Journalism School's class of 2016 in August.</p> 

          <p>Journalism is about sharing stories, seeking the truth and serving the community. I hope to make a career out of doing just that.</p>
