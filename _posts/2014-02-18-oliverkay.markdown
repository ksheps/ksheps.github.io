Colored flags mark six continents and obscure most of Europe on the large canvas map that overlooks the living room of a neat two-bedroom apartment just more than two miles from the UCLA campus.

After four years as an officer in the British Army, Oliver Kay ventured to a new city, Los Angeles, to get his education. He graduated with recognition for excellence in service from UCLA in September, and commissioned as a military intelligence officer, this time under a different flag.

Now a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Kay began his military career anew as a cadet in UCLA’s U.S. Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.

“I just wanted to serve my country,” Kay said, after pointing out the area of the South China Sea where his grandfather – his inspiration for joining the military – served.“It sounds very cheesy, but to me, it’s very deep, I actually really mean it.”
