This is the content of the post located below the YAML front matter for each post's markdown file. Following Jekyll structure, each post is located in the _posts directory. 

Post pages prefer vertical-photos over horizontal photos for the image content to the left of the text content. If there is no vertical photo, the post page will use the horizontal photo instead.

The post's content ends with a list of awards and links to the project's github repository and the actual project. If either are empty in the YAML, the respective content won't be shown.
