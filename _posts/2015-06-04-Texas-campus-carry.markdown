Just days after the Texas Senate voted to legalize concealed guns on college campuses, university officials and opponents of the bill are already thinking of ways to limit its reach.

Although some university faculty members and students fought the bill that passed on Sunday, many seem to have embraced amendments that allow schools to place some areas on campuses off-limits to concealed weapons.

"While it is not what we had hoped for, I respect the Legislature's decision," University of Texas Chancellor William H. McRaven said in a statement.

Senate Bill 11, which sailed through the Legislature by a 102-43 vote in the House and a 20-11 vote in the Senate, allows gun owners to carry firearms on campus in classrooms and dorms at state universities.
