desc: 'Some student groups get massive checks totaling up to $35,560.19. Other clubs take home as little as $22.50. Whatever the reason for the uneven funding, it is clear that some student organizations are pocketing huge sums while others accept tiny allocations.'

Every year, students pay more than $4 million to support the undergraduate student government.

That money is meant to support student government programming efforts, advocacy and come back to some students through student group allocations.

But what happens once that money enters the coffers of the Undergraduate Students Association Council can be difficult to track.

The money is divvied up into four main categories: officer stipends, USAC office budgets, major funds and administrative costs.

USAC also funnels money into another, somewhat untracked, avenue: officially recognized student groups.

But the allocations USAC makes to student groups carries huge disparities with some groups getting thousands of dollars in the 2014-2015 academic year and others receiving pocket change.
