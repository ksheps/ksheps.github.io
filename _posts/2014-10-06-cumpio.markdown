TANAUAN, Philippines — Only the floor of the clinic was left, surrounded by wet piles of rubble left after several 16-foot waves devastated the coastal town.

Nerissa Cumpio said she survived by evacuating to her grandmother’s home 4 kilometers inland, but her home and her midwife clinic in Tanauan were completely leveled by the storm surges that accompanied Typhoon Yolanda last November.

“It was like it was bombed,” she said. “It was like we were on another planet. Is this Earth?”

It would be four days before any relief arrived in Tanauan, including efforts from aid agencies supported in part by UCLA student donations.
