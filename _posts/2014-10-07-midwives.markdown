OLONGAPO, Philippines — The team of midwives had no choice but to ride on top of the ambulance because piles of precious medical supplies occupied their seats below.

The ambulance careened through the bumpy, debris-filled streets two weeks after the storm, on its way to the city of Dulag to deliver supplies and services to pregnant women who had no access to food or medical care after the devastating typhoon that hit the Philippines last November.

Even babies began to starve when women who decided to bottle-feed instead of breast-feed lost their source of formula after supermarkets were either destroyed or looted.
