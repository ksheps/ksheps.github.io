Matthew Blank and Ian Flanders first met at a rock climbing gym in Orange County 10 years ago. They became fast friends and started climbing together at Yosemite National Park.

Adding to their adventures, they took up BASE jumping in 2008. The increasingly popular sport involves jumping from enormous heights off ridges and cliffs in a thrilling free-fall before releasing a parachute.

"Imagine the absolute freest activity you've ever done," Blank said. "As soon as you leave the cliff, you have a feeling of total consciousness. Then speed."
