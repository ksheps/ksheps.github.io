TACLOBAN, Philippines — As water inched up the elementary school walls around 5 a.m. after three hours of heavy rain, the mother made her snap decision.

She grabbed her youngest son and swam toward the second-floor staircase inside the Fishermen’s Village Elementary School, toward safety and away from the floodwater seeping into the building.

Behind her, two older children clung to a windowsill in the panic and chaos as people tried to escape the rising water. Algina Lacaba made her way back to the first-story window where her eldest son and daughter were waiting to be rescued and brought them back safely.

“Just seconds more and I could have lost one of my children,” said Lacaba, who lived in Tacloban before the storm. “If I was not alert, I could have lost them.”
