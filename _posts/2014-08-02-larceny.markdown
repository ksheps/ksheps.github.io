People steal. And they do it often.

People steal from shopping centers.

People steal from parked cars.

And in Fredericksburg and the nine surrounding counties, more people steal than commit any other crime.

Larcenies top the list of crimes reported to the Virginia State Police by police departments and sheriffâ€™s offices throughout the state for 2013, a trend that stands the test of time. Larceny virtually always outperforms any other criminal activity.
