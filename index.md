# Katie M. Shepherd

I'm a journalist interested in the intersections between politics and religion. I believe keeping politicians and officials accountable to the public is one of the most important jobs a reporter could do. I also love criminal justice stories and am obsessed with forensic science.

I am a Reston fellow for [The New York Times](//nytimes.com), where I report for the politics desk in Washington, D.C. Previously, I worked for The [Los Angeles Times](//latimes.com) and a small regional paper in northern Virginia, [The Free Lance-Star](//fredericksburg.com).

In May 2016, I graduated with honors from the [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism](//www.journalism.columbia.edu/), where I spent a year developing my data skills, investigative reporting and narrative writing style.  I graduated with a B.A. in English from UCLA in March, 2015.

I have experience breaking news including a [police shooting](//www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-report-of-gunman-opening-fire-bring-lapd-swarm-in-studio-city-20150724-story.html), the [death](//www.fredericksburg.com/news/stafford-county-marine-killed-in-afghanistan/article_2d1e8968-2772-59b8-9a06-958963d1cae0.html) of a United States [Marine](http://www.fredericksburg.com/news/marine-laid-to-rest-in-aura-of-honor/article_8974d805-cddf-5c57-bc1e-6dd7749af81d.html), and local Los Angeles County [law](//www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-uber-legal-lax-20150716-story.html) [changes](//www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-county-minimum-wage-20150721-story.html). My reporting spans more than six states, touching on [higher education](//graphics.dailybruin.com/prime/fall-2014/mental-health/) in California, [gun regulations](//www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-campus-carry-20150604-story.html) in Texas, [abortion policy](//www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-abortion-idaho-20150530-story.html) in Idaho and local [artists](//www.fredericksburg.com/news/woman-once-homeless-gives-back-through-art/article_470a9e14-0298-535b-81ad-b70506200169.html) and [landmarks](//www.fredericksburg.com/news/swimming-continues-at-fredericksburg-quarry-despite-teen-s-death/article_c64cd70b-7d61-51b1-903c-44d3eca0f9db.html) in Virginia. I've also reported [on religion](//www.coveringreligion.org) in Italy and [nonprofit relief aid](//yolanda.dailybruin.com/chapter-1/through-hell-and-high-water/) in the Philippines.
